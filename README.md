# prework-study-guide webpage
A study guide for course pre-work.

It's a project for bootcamp student to review what they have learnt in the prework session and helps them do better in the bootcamp.

It provides some handy tips and efficient problem solving solution for bootcamp student, so they don't have to review the prework modules when they foget anything.

I learned the basic rules of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic knowlegue of GitHub, Git Bash, and VS Code.
